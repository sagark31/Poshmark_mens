Here I am going to analysis the men's section from the poshmark website. First I scraped the data like title, category, sale_price , normal_price, seller's name, and product size. Then created an data frame out of raw data for further data analysis then done some data cleaning like changing column name, removing characters, handling duplicates, changing data types and then used some visulization for finding relationship between various features.

Second thing I have done a rough Statistical Analysis and build an rough regression model for predicting sale_price value based on regular_price.

At last I exported the data in csv for using in creating an PowerBI dashboard.
